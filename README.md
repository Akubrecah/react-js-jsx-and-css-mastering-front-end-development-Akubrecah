## 📂 Key Features

- **📝 Full-Featured Task Manager**: Add, complete, delete, and filter tasks. Your tasks are automatically saved to your browser's local storage.

- **🌓 Light & Dark Mode**: A theme switcher that toggles the application between light and dark modes, with the user's preference saved locally.
- **📱 Fully Responsive Design**: The layout is optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens using Tailwind CSS.
- **🧩 Component-Based Architecture**: Built with reusable and well-structured React components.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Vite**: As the fast front-end build tool.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For utility-first styling and responsive design.
- **React Router**: For client-side routing and navigation.
- **React Hooks**: (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, `useMemo`) for state management and side effects.
- **Custom Hooks**: A `useLocalStorage` hook for persisting data.
- **React Feather**: For clean and simple icons.
